This is what we got done in class. I wish we had more time to cover the whole
page but I think you guys have learned a lot in the short amount of time we had
available.

## Setup
1. Add all the files into a new directory
2. Open a terminal window and use `cd` to navigate to the folder.
3. Run an http server:
    + (Mac) `php -S localhost:8000`
    + (Windows)(Python 3.X) `python -m http.server`
    + (Windows)(Python 2.X) `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`
5. Then open `localhost:8000` in your browser window.
