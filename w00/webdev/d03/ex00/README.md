This is the simple example dashboard I made for the BTC API.

I have added a bunch of comments to the [app.js](app.js) and [index.html](index.html).

## Setup
1. Add all the files into a new directory
2. Open a terminal window and use `cd` to navigate to the folder.
3. Run an http server:
    + (Mac) `php -S localhost:8000`
    + (Windows)(Python 3.X) `python -m http.server`
    + (Windows)(Python 2.X) `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`
5. Then open `localhost:8000` in your browser window.
