## index.html

The `index.html` is special because whenever a browser visits a folder, it first looks for an `index.html` file. If it finds one, then it will display it to the user. If it can't be found, it will show the user the filesystem.

When we create our "home page" we will always name it `index.html`.

## File Structure

First of all, lets talk about paths.

![CSS Format](https://i.stack.imgur.com/ItVCZ.png) Hint: directory is just another word for folder.

1. For fun, lets create a new folder with at least 4 files (one should be an `index.html`).
2. Open up each of those files and link them together with `<a href="{{url}}"></a>` replacing `{{url}}` with the relative path to your files.
3. Open up the `index.html` in Google Chrome.

## JavaScript
JS goes inside the `<script></script>` tag.
You can use it to change CSS, add and remove HTML elements, and much more.
