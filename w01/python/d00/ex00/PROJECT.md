### Area Calculator

1. Tell the user what your program will do.
2. Ask the user whether they would like to calculate the area of a `square`, `rectangle`, `triangle`, or a `circle`.
3. Once you find out which shape they need calculated, proceed to ask them the required variables: `width`, `height`, `radius`, etc.
4. Then, tell the user which shape they picked and its area.
